PHP debugging

This was a solo project carried out from the 15th to the 16th of March 2021 as part of the BeCode Li√®ge's Junior Web Developer program. We were given 10 exercises to learn about PHP's debugging.
Learning objectives

    understanding the root of bug fixing
    know what print_r, var_dump, die, echo, exit, break do
    know what to do the next time you're stuck
    give yourself the solver's mentality, a problem is just an opportunity to learn!

The mission:

Debugging is the pinpoint to being a master in any coding language. Everyone gets errors, but the best programmers never let it stop them and they find a way to fix it every time! I scoured the internet for a debugging guide, that I felt like I could get behind and here it is: The guide

This is what I feel like doing when coding PHP that doesn't mean that this should be your way. Discover, look up, research whatever ways work for you to debug you code!

I encourage you to use xDebug as much as possible!
